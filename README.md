This guide contains information about survival, opened borders, the required documents to cross said borders. It's a global website on which all valuable information will be held for Ukrainian refugees.


## Adding New Languages

The translation files are located in `public/locales/`. You can simply copy and
rename the `en` folder and update the translations as needed.

When adding a new language, you also need to add it to the list of locales in
`configs/languages.js` (if you don't know how to do this then just create a
pull request anyway and the reviewer can handle it).

## Creating a PR

Please base your work off of the `main` branch, and target your PR at `main`
when you're finished.

## Deploying to Production

Simply merge `main` into `prod` and it will be automatically deployed.
